Hi!  My name is Emma Hershey and I am a senior studying computer science and math with a minor in music at Tufts University.  When I'm not working on my web programming homework, you can catch me singing with the Tufts Jazz Orchestra or with Tufts sQ!, a co-ed a cappella group.
<p>Here are some fun facts about me:
<ul>
	<li>I am a die-hard Patriots fan.</li>
	<li>I volunteer as a medical translator for a surgical team in Peru annually.</li>
	<li>I once raced in the National Toboggan Championships with my family on a home-made sled.</li>
</ul>
